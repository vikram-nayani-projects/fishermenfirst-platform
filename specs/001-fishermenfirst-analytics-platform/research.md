## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
**Rationale**:
- Server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
- Built-in API routes eliminate need for separate backend for simple operations
- Strong TypeScript support for type safety
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading
- Vercel deployment optimization

**Alternatives considered**:
- React with Vite: Lacks SSR and API routes
- SvelteKit: Smaller ecosystem, less mature
- Vue.js/Nuxt: Less suitable for complex data applications

### Backend & Database
**Decision**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auto-generated APIs)
**Rationale**:
- Real-time subscriptions for quota updates
- Row Level Security perfect for program isolation
- Auto-generated REST APIs reduce development time
- Built-in authentication with magic links
- Managed PostgreSQL with automated backups
- Audit logging capabilities

**Alternatives considered**:
- Firebase: Limited SQL capabilities, vendor lock-in
- Custom Node.js + PostgreSQL: More development overhead
- PlanetScale: MySQL limitations for complex queries

### Authentication
**Decision**: Supabase Auth with Magic Links
**Rationale**:
- Passwordless reduces user friction for vessel operators
- Built into Supabase ecosystem
- Secure email-based authentication
- Supports role-based access control

**Alternatives considered**:
- Auth0: Additional cost and complexity
- Custom JWT: Security implementation overhead
- Government SSO: Not available for Alaska fisheries

### Email Processing
**Decision**: n8n workflow automation
**Rationale**:
- Visual workflow designer for non-technical users
- Strong email parsing capabilities
- Integrates well with Supabase webhooks
- Self-hosted for data security
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

**Alternatives considered**:
- Zapier: Cloud-only, data security concerns
- Custom Node.js: Development overhead
- AWS SES + Lambda: Higher complexity

### Styling & UI
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Good performance (purged CSS)
- Excellent component library with shadcn/ui

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI: Heavy bundle size
- Chakra UI: Less customization flexibility
- Custom CSS: Development overhead

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
**Rationale**:
- Jest for unit testing business logic
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright for end-to-end user scenarios
- Good TypeScript support across all tools

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress: Slower execution, limited browser support
- Vitest: Less mature ecosystem
- Selenium: More complex setup

### Deployment & Hosting
**Decision**: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend) + Railway (n8n)
**Rationale**:
- Vercel optimized for Next.js deployment
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Supabase managed database and APIs
- Railway for self-hosted n8n workflows

**Alternatives considered**:
- AWS: Higher complexity and cost
- DigitalOcean: More manual configuration
- Netlify: Less Next.js optimization

## Architecture Patterns

### Data Isolation Strategy
**Decision**: Database-level isolation with RLS policies
**Rationale**:
- Enforces security at the data layer
- Prevents accidental cross-program access
- Simplified application logic
- Audit trail built into database

### State Management
**Decision**: React Server Components + Supabase real-time
**Rationale**:
- Reduces client-side complexity
- Real-time updates for quota changes
- Better SEO and performance
- Simpler data fetching patterns

### API Design
**Decision**: Hybrid approach - Supabase for CRUD, Next.js API for complex logic
**Rationale**:
- Leverage Supabase auto-generated APIs for simple operations
- Custom API routes for business rule calculations
- Maintains type safety across the stack

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Next.js ISR + Supabase connection pooling
**Rationale**:
- ISR for static content like reports
- Database connection pooling for efficiency
- CDN caching via Vercel

### Real-time Updates
**Decision**: Selective Supabase subscriptions
**Rationale**:
- Only Rockfish quota pages use real-time features
- TEM uses manual refresh to reduce complexity
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security Policies
**Decision**: User-based and role-based RLS
**Rationale**:
- Vessels see only their own data
- Managers see all data within their program
- Admins have read-only cross-program access
- Enforced at database level

### API Security
**Decision**: Supabase JWT + API route validation
**Rationale**:
- Consistent authentication across all endpoints
- Request validation at API boundaries
- Rate limiting through Vercel

## Compliance & Audit Requirements

### Data Retention
**Decision**: Permanent retention with soft deletes
**Rationale**:
- Regulatory requirement for historical data
- Soft deletes maintain referential integrity
- Automated backup strategies

### Audit Logging
**Decision**: Database triggers + application logging
**Rationale**:
- Captures all data changes automatically
- User action tracking in application layer
- Immutable audit trail

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
**Decision**: Git with feature branches
**Rationale**:
- Standard development workflow
- Integration with deployment pipelines
- Code review processes

### Testing Approach
**Decision**: Test-driven development with contract testing
**Rationale**:
- Ensures API compatibility
- Catches breaking changes early
- Supports refactoring with confidence

## Error Handling & Monitoring

### Error Tracking
**Decision**: Built-in Next.js error boundaries + Supabase logs
**Rationale**:
- Client-side error capture
- Server-side logging through Supabase
- Cost-effective monitoring solution

### File Processing
**Decision**: Store-first approach with retry logic
**Rationale**:
- Never lose incoming data files
- Retry failed processing attempts
- Manual intervention for edge cases

## Scalability Considerations

### Database Scaling
**Decision**: Supabase managed scaling + read replicas
**Rationale**:
- Handles expected 25 concurrent users
- Room for growth with managed scaling
- Read replicas for reporting queries

### Frontend Scaling
**Decision**: Vercel Edge Functions + CDN
**Rationale**:
- Global edge deployment
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Cost-effective for low-to-medium traffic

## Integration Points

### Email Systems
**Decision**: IMAP integration via n8n
**Rationale**:
- Supports multiple email providers
- Reliable email polling and parsing
- Error handling for malformed emails

### Reporting Systems
**Decision**: PDF generation via React components
**Rationale**:
- Consistent styling with web interface
- Server-side rendering for performance
- Export capabilities for regulatory submission

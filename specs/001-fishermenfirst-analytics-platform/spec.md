# Feature Specification: FishermenFirst Analytics Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-fishermenfirst-analytics-platform`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "FishermenFirst Analytics Platform - Alaska fishery management platform with two separate programs: TEM (pollock) with automated email data ingestion and 4-trip violation calculations, and Rockfish with manual quota entry and real-time tracking. Tech stack: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Next.js frontend, n8n automation, strict program data isolation with tem_ and rp_ table prefixes, Row Level Security, audit trails, vessel/manager portals"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Alaska fishery management platform with two programs
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Vessels, TEM Managers, Rockfish Managers, Platform Admins
   ‚Üí Actions: Track landings, calculate violations, manage quotas, transfer quotas
   ‚Üí Data: Pollock landings, rockfish quotas, vessel data, violation records
   ‚Üí Constraints: Complete program isolation, audit requirements, regulatory compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific user permissions and access levels]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data retention and archival policies]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flows: vessel data entry, manager oversight, violation tracking
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on regulatory compliance and data integrity
6. Identify Key Entities (fishery data management)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties around user permissions and data policies"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What authentication method should the system use for user login? ‚Üí A: Magic link authentication (passwordless email-based)
- Q: How long must the system retain fishing data? ‚Üí A: Indefinitely (permanent archive)
- Q: What's the expected concurrent user load during peak usage? ‚Üí A: Low (10-25 simultaneous users)
- Q: When should the system alert users about approaching Rockfish quota limits? ‚Üí A: Multiple alerts (80%, 90%, 95%)
- Q: What happens when a vessel attempts to exceed their allocated quota during a landing entry? ‚Üí A: Allow but flag as overage requiring resolution

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Alaska fishery participants need a secure platform to track their fishing activities, comply with federal regulations, and manage quota allocations across two distinct programs (TEM for pollock and Rockfish) without any cross-program data access.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a vessel operator receives pollock landing data, **When** the system processes four consecutive trips, **Then** the system calculates average catch and identifies any regulatory violations
2. **Given** a rockfish manager needs to track quota usage, **When** vessels report landings, **Then** remaining quotas are updated in real-time with accurate balances
3. **Given** a vessel wants to transfer quota to another vessel, **When** the transfer is initiated, **Then** both vessels' allocations are updated atomically with full audit trail
4. **Given** a platform administrator reviews system activity, **When** accessing either program's data, **Then** they can view read-only information without modification capabilities
5. **Given** a TEM manager processes violation data, **When** reviewing trip averages, **Then** they can generate compliance reports and calculate appropriate penalties

### Edge Cases
- What happens when landing data contains errors or is received late?
- How does system handle quota transfers that would exceed vessel or processor caps?
- What occurs when a vessel switches between programs mid-season?
- How are historical violations tracked when regulations change?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain complete data isolation between TEM and Rockfish programs with no cross-program access
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically calculate 4-trip averages for TEM pollock landings and identify violations exceeding 300,000 pounds
- **FR-003**: System MUST process incoming landing data via automated email parsing with validation and error handling
- **FR-004**: System MUST track real-time quota balances for rockfish vessels and alert when approaching limits
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable quota transfers between vessels with manager approval and atomic updates
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain comprehensive audit trails for all data changes and user actions
- **FR-007**: System MUST support role-based access control with vessel, manager, and admin permission levels
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate compliance reports and violation notices for regulatory submission
- **FR-009**: System MUST track salmon bycatch against fleet-wide caps with automated alerts
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to view their own vessel data and quota balances through dedicated portals
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate all landing data against business rules before processing
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle data corrections with full version history and recalculation capabilities
- **FR-013**: Managers MUST be able to manually enter quota allocations and adjustments
- **FR-014**: System MUST prevent negative quota balances and enforce vessel/processor cap limits
- **FR-015**: System MUST authenticate users via magic link authentication (passwordless email-based login)
- **FR-016**: System MUST retain fishing data indefinitely for permanent historical compliance archive
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle concurrent usage of up to 25 simultaneous users during peak operations
- **FR-018**: System MUST alert Rockfish vessels at 80%, 90%, and 95% of quota usage with progressive warnings
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow quota overage landings but flag them as requiring manager resolution

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Vessel**: Individual fishing boats with unique identifiers, size classifications, program participation, and owner/operator information
- **Landing**: Individual fishing trip records containing catch amounts, dates, locations, and species data
- **Quota Allocation**: Assigned fishing limits per vessel/species with remaining balances and transfer history
- **Violation Record**: Documented regulatory infractions with penalty amounts, violation types, and resolution status
- **User Account**: System access credentials tied to vessels or management roles with appropriate permissions
- **Audit Log**: Complete record of all system changes with timestamps, user identification, and affected data
- **Transfer Transaction**: Quota movement records between vessels including approval status and effective dates
- **Season Configuration**: Annual program parameters including dates, caps, and regulatory limits
